## **What is IAM in AWS?**

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a **security service** that helps you **control access** to AWS resources securely.  
It allows you to:
- **Authenticate** (who can log in)
- **Authorize** (what they can do)
Think of it like a **security guard** that decides:

> “Who are you?” and “What are you allowed to do?
